# Coursera Machine Learning

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. It is mainly theoretical since it explains all the math passages behind the most effective machine learning techniques. In addition to the theoretical lessons there are quizes at the end of every section and some practical projects to be developed in Matlab, in order to became familiar with the basics of the implementation of these algorithms.
You'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems.

## Tools

SECTION TO BE COMPLETED

**Language**: Python, Matlab


## Material

**Website**

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/

The course website. It provides both the teorethical lessons and the practical projects material in Matlab.

## Topics

1. Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
2. Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
3. Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
