# Stanford ML and DL cheatsheets

These documents are collections of quick concepts, examples and brief explanations related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Deep Learning.

They are not as useful for learning those concepts (since the content is really synthetic), but they can be used to explore new concepts or revise old ones.

The first module of AI and all the modules of ML and DL are the most useful for ML and DL.
