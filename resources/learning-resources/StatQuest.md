# StatQuest

StatQuest is a YouTube channel providing almost 200 videos on various topics regarding statistics, machine learning and deep learning.  
The videos have a very slow pace, introducing all necessary content or linking to previous videos where prerequisites have already been presented in more detail. The maths are presented in detail although without many formalisms (the concepts are presented in order to require only very basic math prerequisites).

In general this channel is really good to get a good, clear and intuitive explanation on any given topic, with a particular focus on statistics and machine learning in general, although there is a playlist devoted to deep learning.
