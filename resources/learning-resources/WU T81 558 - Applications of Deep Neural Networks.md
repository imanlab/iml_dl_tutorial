# Washington University T81 558 - Applications of Deep Neural Networks

This course is heavily focused on programming and a hands-on approach, which can be very useful to start. It has almost no prerequisites since the first modules cover both the basics of Python and of deep learning, however deep learning concepts are only summarily presented and some previous theoretical knowledge is advised.

The great advantage of this course is the constant reference to complete and working implementation in Python/Keras. Also, it gives a complete introduction to Google Colab.  
Colab is a tool by Google which provides you with direct access through a web page to a Python environment pre-configured for machine learning: all the main libraries are already installed and configured, nothing has to be installed on your device and you also have access to Google's GPU which usually are much more powerful than the average laptop.

The assignments (one for each module) are really helpful to recap the content of each module and to have some hands-on experience (note: assignment **cannot** be submitted and corrected/evaluated).
