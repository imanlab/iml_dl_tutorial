This folder collects various resources such as videos, tutorials, websites, guides, references, cheatsheets and the like which might be useful when studying Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## Where to start

The beginning is always confusing: the exact place where to start might vary depending on your previous knowledge and skills.

Have a look [here](where-to-start.md) for some guidance.

## `conda`

When working with machine learning Python is the go-to language and one of the reasons is that it has a multitude of packages for data science, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, math and so on. Unfortunately installing and managing those packages can become quite difficult when working on multiple projects. `conda` is a package and environment management system that is really helpful to reduce such problems to the minimum.

Have a look at the [conda](conda) folder for anything related to that.

## Learning resources

There is a lot of information on ML and DL on the web. We have collected the most useful courses, tutorials and references in a single place with short informative descriptions and brief contents summaries.

You can find them [here](learning-resources).
