## About

The purpose of this repository is to provide a starting point for anyone who is approaching the world of deep learning.  
It contains a curated collection of useful resources and some simple projects that can be used to get some practical hands-on experience.

## Getting Started

If you are completely new the best place to start probably is the ["where to start"](resources/where-to-start.md) page.

## Examples

The [examples](examples) folder contains some practical examples that you can look at, analyze and test to get a first hands-on experience with deep learning code.
It also contains a simple tutorial for a first approach to Graph Datasets and graph Neural Networks.
